# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continually seeking opportunities to expand my skills and apply them to real-world data analysis scenarios. This project involves analyzing a dataset to understand various factors influencing student graduation rates. By leveraging data analysis techniques and visualization, I aim to uncover insights that can inform educational strategies and policies.

The dataset used in this analysis contains information on students' academic and demographic characteristics, such as marital status, application mode, course, admission grade, age at enrollment, and curricular units' grades. The data was sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).

The primary purpose of this software is to analyze the dataset to identify trends and correlations between various factors and graduation rates. This analysis will help in understanding which factors are most indicative of students' academic success and provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers.

# Data Analysis Results

1. **Marital Status**: The analysis showed that students' marital status has a noticeable impact on dropout rates. Single students had higher dropout rates compared to married students, indicating that marital status may influence academic persistence and completion.

2. **Application Mode**: Different application modes, such as direct application, referral, or through special programs, were analyzed to see their effect on dropout rates. The results suggested that students who applied through referral programs had lower dropout rates, potentially due to better preparation or support systems.

3. **Course**: Examining the distribution of students across various courses revealed significant differences in dropout rates. Courses with more practical components or those aligned with students' career goals had lower dropout rates, suggesting the importance of course relevance and engagement in academic success.

4. **Admission Grade**: A strong correlation was found between higher admission grades and lower dropout rates. Students with better academic performance at the time of admission were more likely to graduate, highlighting the predictive value of admission grades.

5. **Age at Enrollment**: The analysis indicated that age at enrollment plays a role in graduation rates. Younger students tended to have higher graduation rates, while older students faced more challenges in completing their education, possibly due to additional responsibilities or longer gaps in their education history.

6. **Curricular Units' Grades**: Performance in curricular units during the first and second semesters was closely linked to dropout rates. Students who performed well in these initial courses were more likely to persist and graduate, emphasizing the importance of early academic success in a student's educational journey.

7. **Graduation Rates by Parents' Qualification**: The graduation rates were significantly influenced by the education levels of the students' parents. Higher parental qualifications, particularly mother's qualifications, were associated with higher graduation rates. This suggests that parental education may provide students with better academic support and motivation.
